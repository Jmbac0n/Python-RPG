        You are walking through the woods. It's a quiet day and
        the journey should be trivial. Suddenly a shadow darts
        behind you and sprints between the trees. It turns and emerges
        from the shadows. It's a wolf, prepare yourself!

        You have bested the wolf! You are now free to continue on your
        journey to the nearby village.

        When you arrive at the village it is absolute chaos. People are
        running about screaming and a few of the houses have caught fire.
        You reach the square and see a goblin spewing spells from his
        clawed fingers. Feeling a newfound sense of heroism you strike!
